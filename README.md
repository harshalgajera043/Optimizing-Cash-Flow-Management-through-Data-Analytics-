# Littlefield Cash Flow Management Simulation
## Project Overview
This project, Littlefield Cash Flow Management Simulation, was developed as part of the SCM 551 course to simulate operational efficiency and financial planning in a dynamic manufacturing environment. Our objective was to optimize cash flow and resource allocation through effective inventory management, machine utilization, and strategic financial planning.

## Key Objectives
1. Maintain Lean Inventory: Implemented a Just-In-Time (JIT) approach using FIFO-based inventory strategies to align reorder points (ROP) and economic order quantities (EOQ) with demand, reducing excess stock and avoiding stockouts.
2. Optimize Machine Utilization: Increased production capacity and efficiency by monitoring station utilization and making strategic machine purchases based on real-time demand patterns.
3. Enhance Cash Flow: Minimized loan dependency and early loan repayment to reduce financial risk and maximize cash flow, aligning financial decisions with operational needs.
## Features and Methodology
1. Demand Forecasting and Rolling Forecast:

* Used historical demand data to predict future needs and adjusted inventory thresholds in real-time.
* Applied regression models for forecasting and optimized reorder points to ensure a balanced supply-demand ratio.
2. Machine Purchases and Capacity Adjustments:
* Added machines based on 80% utilization thresholds to prevent bottlenecks and improve production efficiency.
* Sold excess machines as demand normalized, optimizing operational costs and maintaining lean processes.
3. Financial Analysis and Cash Flow Management:
* Strategically managed cash flow by balancing loan needs with operational requirements, resulting in an improved cash position.
* Integrated financial analysis for resource allocation, yielding a final profit of $700K by optimizing turnover and reducing financial exposure.
## Results
1. Inventory Management: Achieved a 20% reduction in excess stock by continuously aligning inventory to demand.
2. Operational Efficiency: Enhanced throughput and minimized downtime with a targeted capacity strategy.
3. Financial Outcomes: Generated a total profit of $700K, reflecting effective cash flow optimization and strategic planning.
## Learnings and Future Recommendations
This simulation emphasized the importance of adaptable financial strategies, real-time data integration, and operational flexibility. Future work could explore further automation of forecast adjustments and advanced analytics to support decision-making in similar dynamic environments.
